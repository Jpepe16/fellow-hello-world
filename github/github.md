#### Traditionally, when learning a new programming language, the first thing you do is figure out how to print out, "Hello, world!" We're going to try something a bit different.

### Git on [GitHub](https://github.com/)!

If you already have a GitHub account, [log in](https://github.com/login)!

If you don't, [sign up](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)!
* You should use one of **your** email addresses (not your work email).
* Selected the **Unlimited public repositories for free** option.
* Verify your email.

### Fork this website's [repository](https://github.com/julescubtree/fellow-hello-world/)

_put image here_

A repository (repo for short) is a collection of the source code for a software project.

To fork a repo is to make your own copy.

In the open source world, you're encouraged to build on existing source code and contribute it back to the community. In a little bit, you're going to do just that, and you'll start by editing your copy of the code.

### Find **your** file

In our repo, and now in yours, there's a file just for you. Can you find it? You'll need to

* find your fork of our repo (maybe find your own GitHub profile page first?)
* poke around in some code and some folders

If you find it really fast, and your fellow fellows could use some help, help away.

### Make your file your own

Once you've found your file, edit it! You're free to be ultra-traditional and leave "Hello, world!" in there, but you don't have to.

There's a header section up top marked by three hyphens on the top and the bottom; there you can change the page title.

You're also free to change anything outside the header. The file is in a language called Markdown, which is designed to make it easy to add formatting. You can look at the [basics](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) of the language, or even the source code of this web page to see some things you can do.

When you're done editing, you're going to commit (i.e. save) your changes way down at the bottom. Select the option to **Commit directly** to the current branch.

### Submit a pull request

This means you've made a change in your copy of the source code, and you'd like for whoever's in charge to "pull" it into the main version.
